# Arduino_LED_Strip_Controller
In this project we will see how to build an Arduino Led Strip Controller!

To better understand how to control a LED using an Arduino watch the Youtube Tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pQlGFEgBSDU&ab_channel=TheWorkshop

First you will need to assemble the following circuit:

Then you need to upload the Arduino sketch to the Arduino nano.
The "RGB_LED_Strip_Controller_Test.ino" is used to make sure the circuit is working correctly, and will only flash the RGB colors sequentially.
The "RGB_LED_Strip_Controller_PWM.ino" is a library which includes different animations for yout RGB led strip.
